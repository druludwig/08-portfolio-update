# Portfolio Update


Open portfolio: http://meetDru.com

---

My portfolio is in the first draft of an entire rebuild. I've used some bootstrap cards since they're clean and simple, but I'll likely change this up as I progress in the course. I understand the audience I'm coding for is going to make hiring decisions based on these very design choices.
- My resume and LinkedIn are currently tailored towards a business analyst role, and will be re-worked after attending a resume webinar.
- I've purposely chosen a clean and simple color scheme for this version of my portfolio. I'll incorporate color once I've settled on a color for my personal brand.
